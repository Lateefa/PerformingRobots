# Final Project; By(t)e World; Final assignment

Watching the final product of Ali and I's hardwork finally come to fruition during the IM show was an experience I don't think i'll be forgetting. Seeing everything I visualized conceptually come to life was a very magical moment. I wanted to create a character that had personality, a robot that people would love and want to take care of. And I think that the reactions I got from people after the show were beyond what I was expecting. Everyone loved Bit and his personality really came to life thanks to the text-to-speech part that Ali worked on. Since the TFT screen that I used was too small and only the front row people could really see what his facial features looked like, the voice gave him the extra bit of personality that I was looking for. 
In terms of construction and materials learning how to create sturdy projects and not just prototypes is something that I really appreciate getting into, Like learning how to create t-slot boxes and 3D-printing motor brackets to make sure the robot does not fall apart during the performance. Knowing what I know now I think would make building things a little easier in terms of avoiding mistakes when making blueprints for what a project would look like. 

As for the electronic part of my project, I had to opt to using two arduinos instead of just one and using the stacking method to access the pins that I needed to operate my TFT screen through bluetooth because it was not working out and I was running out of time. The blutetooth and motors operate the same way they did when we created our first prototype projects, I opted for running the motors at the speed of 255 because I could not find a balance around the slower speeds to make my robot still move straight. In the end it looked good because it worked out with my robots personality. 

Software wise I built upon the sample code for the TFT screen and loaded in the photos based on the time passed, so after 10 seconds Bit's face changes to another expression and then I worked on timing the image of Cyte with the projection part of the performance because I couldnt control the screen using bluetooth. After around 3 minutes and a half it changes the image to Cyte.

I think the most difficult parts of my project has been learning to use new things like different types of screens and arduino stacking and continuously failing in getting them to work. Also coming to terms with the fact that when things don't work you need to let go of them. At a lot of points during the creation of this project I had found myself frustrated with my failures because I kept constantly having to deal with worst case scenarious. Although in the end everything played out extremely well and I'm glad that I managed to adapt to these changes.

# Update on Final Project Idea;
So far, the greatest challenge Ali and I found was to figure out a new plan/performance besides our initial idea because of the restraints. We found a good alternative that we’re both happy with regardless of the lack of interactivity as it will still portray the concept of the digital world and the analog world connecting together. For our current idea we’re planning on creating a performance that tells a story of the relationship of the robot with the projection, both being separate entities. The robot will be controlled via Bluetooth and have pre-coded sequences that I will control/play out during the performance. I’m hoping to have a screen to run on the robot to portray its expressions more clearly to the audience as it won’t have any speech. The plan is to have the audience interpret what the robot is saying but understand the text from the projection; the audience will fill in the blanks for the robot. The robot will be this being that is able to express itself physically only. 
Parts list besides what we already have, we would like to look into getting a [GLCD-display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/253) besides that we’re covered on everything else.




# Final Project Idea;
  Ali and I both liked the initial idea I've had of the lost robot in the Art's centre and wanted to create a performance that interacts with the audience. From Ali's side the projection would show a 2-minute or so story explaining how the robot got lost and with a map of where to find it. The audience then leaves to bring back the robot to the stage. We wanted to show the interactivity of the physical and the digital with this performance, people mostly associate robots with the digital world when in truth they're very much physical. When the Robot reaches the stage, an interaction between the robot and the projection happens which brings the story to an end. 
  As for the things we're going to use/need depending on how testing goes we would either use a bluetooth controller for the audience to drive the robot home or use something like a distance sensor and have the robot seem like an AI. As for the screen for the robot I was thinking of either a Graphic LCD 128x64, Graphic LCD 84x48 - Nokia 5110 or Graphic LCD 160x128 Huge depending on which size would work better. Finally for the size and dimensions of the Robot there are two posibilites that will depend on our choice of a screen, if we could get a bigger one the robot would be small enough for the screen to cover an entire side, but if we go for a smaller screen the robot will be long with the screen on top so it could at least reach eye level.

Sumo Robots are used in Robo-Sumo sport competitions in Japan where two robots compete against eachother. Whichever robot knocks out or leaves the circle loses, much like normal Sumo wrestling. I do not necessarily see this as an artistic performance but still an interesting one, each performance differs from the previous one as it is a competition and not an exhibition. Furthermore the robots all have different designs and mechanisms which makes them more interesting.
