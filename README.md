# PerformingRobots


# Final Project Idea;
  Ali and I both liked the initial idea I've had of the lost robot in the Art's centre and wanted to create a performance that interacts with the audience. From Ali's side the projection would show a 2-minute or so story explaining how the robot got lost and with a map of where to find it. The audience then leaves to bring back the robot to the stage. We wanted to show the interactivity of the physical and the digital with this performance, people mostly associate robots with the digital world when in truth they're very much physical. When the Robot reaches the stage, an interaction between the robot and the projection happens which brings the story to an end. 
  As for the things we're going to use/need depending on how testing goes we would either use a bluetooth controller for the audience to drive the robot home or use something like a distance sensor and have the robot seem like an AI. As for the screen for the robot I was thinking of either a Graphic LCD 128x64, Graphic LCD 84x48 - Nokia 5110 or Graphic LCD 160x128 Huge depending on which size would work better. Finally for the size and dimensions of the Robot there are two posibilites that will depend on our choice of a screen, if we could get a bigger one the robot would be small enough for the screen to cover an entire side, but if we go for a smaller screen the robot will be long with the screen on top so it could at least reach eye level.

Sumo Robots are used in Robo-Sumo sport competitions in Japan where two robots compete against eachother. Whichever robot knocks out or leaves the circle loses, much like normal Sumo wrestling. I do not necessarily see this as an artistic performance but still an interesting one, each performance differs from the previous one as it is a competition and not an exhibition. Furthermore the robots all have different designs and mechanisms which makes them more interesting.
