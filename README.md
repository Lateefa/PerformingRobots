Sumo Robots are used in Robo-Sumo sport competitions in Japan where two robots compete against eachother. Whichever robot knocks out or leaves the circle loses, much like normal Sumo wrestling. I do not necessarily see this as an artistic performance but still an interesting one, each performance differs from the previous one as it is a competition and not an exhibition. Furthermore the robots all have different designs and mechanisms which makes them more interesting.
